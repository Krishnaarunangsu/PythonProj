# We can use + operator to combine two tuples. This is called concatenation.
# We can also repeat the elements in a tuple for a given number of times using the * operator.
# Both + and * operations result in a new tuple


# Concatenation
# Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
print((1, 2, 3) + (4, 5, 6))

# Repeat
# Output: ('Repeat', 'Repeat', 'Repeat')
print(("Repeat",) * 3)
